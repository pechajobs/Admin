Failling to follow the guidelines pertaining to the two acceptable types of RFWs will automatically lead to disfqualification of the RFW. 

Take time to complete each section below with as much detail as is required to establish a comprehensive understanding about the underlying product specification.

**ALL BELOW FIELDS ARE REQUIRED**

<h2 id="owner">Owner</h2>

*Who is the owner of this request?*

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

*What is being introduced, added, changed, deleted and why; explain it in short and concise form. Basically, this section provides a high-level overview and summary of what will be elaborated upon below.*

<h2 id="is-this-really-necessary">Is This Really Necessary?</h2>

*When answering this question, keep in mind, everything done here, is away from doing something else elsewhere. It's not enough for a thing to be a "good choice" or "good way", it should be the "best choice" or "best way".*

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

*Describe in detail the motivation behind the change.*

<h2 id="named-concepts">Named Concepts</h2>

*Clearly introduce any new named concepts used in this RFW*

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

* 1) Explain concretely what will manifest as a result of this RFW.
* 2) Explain how is it different from what is already manifesting i.e. what we already have?*
* 3) Explain what OpenPecha users will experience as a result of this RFW. How will they feel as a result of it? How will they benefit as a result of it?*
* 4) If applicable, provide sample messages for any new messages the system will display as a result of this RFW.*

<h2 id="conceptual-design">Conceptual Design</h2>

*Provide a conceptual overview of the contents of the RFW. Be very specific, spare no words here. At the same time, make sure the conceptual outline is as well structured and detailed as possible.* 

<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>

*What are the possible drawbacks of this? Think carefully how the proposed work will affect what we already have, and the possible ways in which it might end up limiting us in the future, or take us to directions that become diversions from our mission.*

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

*If applicable, explain what alternatives are there available and known to us that would allow achieving the same or similar business value. Particularly pay attention to the 80/20 rule here i.e. alternatives where we might get 80% of the business value with 20% of the work.*

<h2 id="new-data">New Data</h2>

*If applicable, explain clearly the new data artifacts that will result from implementing this proposed work.*

<h2 id="adaption-window">Adaption Window</h2>
